I think that it might contain something important!","quest_1069":"Don't worry! Such parchments were very popular among the ancient Oceanian cultures. To see what's written on the parchment, you must use lemon juice!","quest_1088":"Wow! This parchment is even more valuable than I had imagined. It's a map to an island that used to be inhabited by an ancient civilisation! We must go there!","quest_1090":"Such vast territory! Such architecture! I wonder why it's abandoned. Maybe we can find more information on the island.","quest_1095":"The manuscripts you found in the chests are intriguing! It's said here that the ancient Okoro dynasty lived here for centuries.

You don't know anything about this world yet. You still have a lot to learn.","QUEST_1593":"Wonderful! I've never tasted a drink like that. For that, you deserve a concentrated horseradish recipe.","QUEST_1653":"You have gained Flinzy's trust, which hasn't happened to anyone in a long time. She believes you could help us. Let's start with the extinguished lanterns, they are very important. Let's solve this problem together.","QUEST_1654":"As a result of my research, I've discovered that jellyfish have settled in the lanterns. I might have found out sooner by examining the lanterns more closely... But that's not important. The solution is simple - use the green souls.","QUEST_1761":"Hey, stranger! You've arrived to Atavalp village and my name is chief Mo.","QUEST_1762":"The main occupations of Atavalp village villagers are associated with reeds and llamas. If you want, I can sell you sickle recipe. But Adonsy can teach you how to care for llamas.","QUEST_1765":"You can only get useful food from ripe reeds.

I don't know what to do, but grandpa says, if we find second part, we go ask advice to Elders.","quest_2225":"Sadly no one knows where to find the generous stranger.
