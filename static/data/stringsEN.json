My name is Curiosity Sparks, and I've been exploring Oceania for many years. Recently, I dug up this old chest, but I can't open it. I think that it might contain something important!","quest_1069":"Don't worry! Such parchments were very popular among the ancient Oceanian cultures. To see what's written on the parchment, you must use lemon juice!","quest_1088":"Wow! This parchment is even more valuable than I had imagined. It's a map to an island that used to be inhabited by an ancient civilisation! We must go there!","quest_1090":"Such vast territory! Such architecture! I wonder why it's abandoned. Maybe we can find more information on the island.","quest_1095":"The manuscripts you found in the chests are intriguing! It's said here that the ancient Okoro dynasty lived here for centuries.

Good luck with the underground exploration.","quest_1544":"Hello! I would like to set the island up for summer holidays. My son was doing that, but he has messed everything up. Could you clean the mess and make it usable? I trust you.","QUEST_1586":"AAAAAA! Tfu, who sneaks up from behind like that. Almost gave me a heart attack. Besides, I spilled the dough bowl.

You won't surprise me with those.","QUEST_1592II":"I've only eaten radishes in childhood, but that's not really a recipe...","QUEST_1592III":"Why not live? You don't know anything about this world yet. You still have a lot to learn.","QUEST_1593":"Wonderful! I've never tasted a drink like that. For that, you deserve a concentrated horseradish recipe.","QUEST_1653":"You have gained Flinzy's trust, which hasn't happened to anyone in a long time. She believes you could help us. Let's start with the extinguished lanterns, they are very important. Let's solve this problem together.","QUEST_1654":"As a result of my research, I've discovered that jellyfish have settled in the lanterns. I might have found out sooner by examining the lanterns more closely... But that's not important. The solution is simple - use the green souls.","QUEST_1761":"Hey, stranger! You've arrived to Atavalp village and my name is chief Mo.","QUEST_1762":"The main occupations of Atavalp village villagers are associated with reeds and llamas. If you want, I can sell you sickle recipe. But Adonsy can teach you how to care for llamas.","QUEST_1765":"You can only get useful food from ripe reeds.

I'm busy! I need to take care of a couple of underground tricksters that dare to haunt here.","quest_2108":"Excellent! You've proven your strength, so I'll leave the rest of the passage restoration under your supervision. I think my drills will serve you well.","quest_2134":"Listening to your story, I thought of a very special torch, it's located in the center of Nihiru Island. First, I'd recommend getting to know the islands closer to home, and only then embark on such a long journey.","quest_2136a":"Great, it seems I can teach you a few useful craftsman's tricks.","quest_2136b":"Silence, brother, you're still learning from me! I've accumulated a lot of knowledge about underground stones, from now on I'll be the one to train you!","quest_2199":"Mister camel was only sleeping. Thank you!

I would love if you built trio of pyramids that I haven't seen before.","quest_2223":"Look, we find second part! Sad it's rusted and can't be used. I don't know what to do, but grandpa says, if we find second part, we go ask advice to Elders.","quest_2225":"Sadly no one knows where to find the generous stranger. Elders suggest making a workshop by ourselves on one of the local islands. These tools could certainly be useful for everyone around.","quest_2228":"Nice walls, we will put on roof now, ok? My craftsman friend say he has apprentice that would like to work here.","quest_2235":"Look, the first tool is done! You will need all the rest of materials when you'll want to use this tool. Stone eater will make the process faster, but you will still need energy for 10 actions and enough other special materials for tougher rocks.","quest_2236":"Thank for your help. First tools we gift to you. Remember, if you need more tool, you can trade it for things. Merchants stingy, tool expensive, but we will figure something.","quest_2237":"If you need more stone eaters, you can find a pack of them in the shop. Maybe you'll get some more good deals in the future.","QUEST_3050":"Recently, a man in a brown coat visited the village, he said he planned to go to the local mountains. The stranger left his belongings and first went to explore the surrounding area, but he never returned. I have heard of your courage, but give up your recklessness. Landslides often happen in the mountains.","QUEST_3054":"It was so noisy! Fortunately, nothing fell until the village. In the future, some of the cleared landslides will be restored.

Try it!","quest_690":"Nice, man! Mr Camel has eaten now. You just need to handle the pretty costume part and he will share water with you. You'll sort this out, won't you?","quest_691":"Great! Now Mr Camel looks totally chic. If you feed him, he will share water with you.","quest_698":"Look! I has found a map with an undiscovered island. You can visit it by clicking on the raft and finding Ahe island on the map.","quest_719":"The volcano on Amanu island is silent. When it was working, it was warm on all surrounding islands. Now it's getting chilly. The elders have decided to send you to volcano island to find out what has happened.","quest_720":"Cut through the jungle plants to get to the volcano god.
